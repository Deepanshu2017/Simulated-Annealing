# Simulated-Annealing
Simulated-Annealing is a probabilistic algorithm to find the result of [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
The code in this repository provides a visulization of TSP problem. For this you have to use GraphStream libraries.

# How to use
Download jar files. gs-core-1.3.jar and gs-ui-1.3.jar is important.
Download the out folder if you are trying to run with command line than navigate to out/production/Simulated Annealing and TSP. 
Run in terminal

```
java -cp .:/path/to/downloaded/jar/gs-core-1.3.jar:/path/to/downloaded/jar/gs-ui-1.3.jar sa.SimulatedAnnealing
```
